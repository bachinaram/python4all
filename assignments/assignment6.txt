HOMEWORK1
convert list of list to list 

create a variable and assign list of lists [[1,2,3],[45,34,89],["sneha","suresh","ankith"]]
Now convert list of lists in to single list eg., [1, 2, 3, 45, 34, 89, 'sneha', 'suresh', 'ankith']
to solve this problem you cna use nested for but use it with list comprehension

your output should look like this [1, 2, 3, 45, 34, 89, 'sneha', 'suresh', 'ankith']

HOMEWORK2
Write a program to find give list contains string or integer
Note - There are many ways to find given data in variable in string or not but this examples helps to test your understanding 
on list comprehension and for loop and if conditions. So, please follow the same approach mention below to solve the problem

use the output of homework1 list comprehension list
[1, 2, 3, 45, 34, 89, 'sneha', 'suresh', 'ankith'] as input
now create for loop to list all elements
inside for llo write if condition to check element is sneha or element is suresh or element is ankith if true then 
print "element sneha is a string"/"element ankith is a string"/"element suresh is a string"

else print
element {element} might be an int e.g, element 1 might be an int
