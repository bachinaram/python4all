#eligibility check program
#write a program to take int as inputs for 4 subjects and based on input scores
#if any subject score of user is less than 0 then print "please try prelims again"
#else if user's subject score doesnot contain 0 and at least one subject more than 100 print "over acheiver and moved to next level"
#else your subjects doesnt contain any less than 0 or over 100 print "You are eligible"


#create 4 subject variables like science,math,gk,rl
#use input function and give score to each subject
#e.g., science=int(input("enter your science score: "))
#create list and assign all subjects to list
#e.g., my_score=[science,math,gk,rl]
#and also create 3 boolean variables high=False, low=False, medium=False
#use for loop to loop through all subject scores in my_score
#use if condition as mentioned below
#if eachscore in my_score list is greater than or equal to 100 the assign True to high variable
#else if eachscore in my_score list is less than 0 then assign True to low variable
#else assign True to medium variable

#finally come out of for loop and write another if elif and else
#if low is True then print ("please try prelims again")
#elif high is True then print "over acheiver and moved to next level"
#else print "You are eligible "
